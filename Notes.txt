ML Notes

Data Cleaning
1.  Change content to lower case
2.  Remove stop words such as " a , and " etc - reduces complexity and smaller dataset  and easier during training
3. Regex expression gotcha
    3.1. Use raw strings if your data has special chars that could be interpreted as something else Eg : "C:\desktop\notes"
         can be interpreted as string with new line "\n". but can be prevented using r"C:\desktop\notes"
