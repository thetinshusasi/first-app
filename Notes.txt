ML Notes

Data Cleaning
1.  Change content to lower case
2.  Remove stop words such as " a , and " etc - reduces complexity and smaller dataset  and easier during training
3. Regex expression gotcha
    3.1. Use raw strings if your data has special chars that could be interpreted as something else Eg : "C:\desktop\notes"
         can be interpreted as string with new line "\n". but can be prevented using r"C:\desktop\notes"
4. Tokenization: Word Tokeniztion, sentence tokenization, char Tokenization, sub sentence tokenization (from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize)
5. Stemming: where words are reduced to their base form. For example, words like ‘connecting’ or ‘connected’ will be stemmed to the base form ‘connect’. (from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer).
    Sometimes the base forms are not at all a words
6. Lemmatization: Where stemming removes the last few characters of a word, lemmatization stems the word to a more meaningful base form and ensures it does not lose it's meaning. 
    Lemmatization works more intelligently, referencing a pre-defined dictionary containing the context of words and uses this when diminishing the word to the base form. 


Types of Tagging

1. Part of speech Tagging
2. Names Entity Recogniation
